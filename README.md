# mps-process

This is a port of a previously written Mathematica script for processing data generated by a home-built magnetic particle spectrometer (MPS). The processing primarily consists of Fourier transforming several periods of raw signal to generate harmonics and integrating a signal period of background subtracted data to generate a M(H) hysteresis curve.
